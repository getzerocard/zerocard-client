# Zerocard App

This is a React Native application built with Expo.

## Running the App

### Development

To start the app in development mode with live reloading:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will start the Metro bundler and provide options to open the app in the Expo Go app or a simulator/emulator.

### Production Build

To create a production-ready build of the app (e.g., for submitting to app stores):

```bash
eas build --profile production
```

This command uses Expo Application Services (EAS) to build an optimized standalone app package.
